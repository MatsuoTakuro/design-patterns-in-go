package lsp

// modified LSP
// If a function takes an interface(Sized) and
// works with a type T(Square) that implements this interface(Sized),
// any structure(for example, Rectangle) that aggregates T(Square)
// should also be usable in that function.

// BetterSquare is in compliance with Principle A.
